This program computes A^(2k) where A is an nxn matrix and k is an integer >= 0, using k matrix multiplications. The input file should be formatted as follows: matrix size n in the first line, the value k in the second line, and each of then ext n lines should have the entries of the respective matrix row separated by blanks.

My program is written in C. Its name is 'matrixmult.c'.  In order to compile, type the command 'gcc matrixmult.c -o matrixmult', and then in order to run type the command './matrixmult input_file_name output_file_name'.
