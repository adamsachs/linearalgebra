HW2--README

1) My program essentially uses the pseudocode that we went over in class to perform frontward and backward substitution, with a few minor differences. First, when eliminating below or above the k pivot, it only operates on the rows that have a leading value that's non-zero. For example, with an m value of 5, this is only the first 2 rows above or below the pivot. Additionally, in those rows that we operate on, we only operate on the columns in the coefficient matrix that have a non-zero value. Another difference is that the program stores the 'l' value for the current row, and uses that update the b value for the row (which is held in the last column of the matrix, i.e. an augmented matrix). The output is the augmented matrix that consists of the identity matrix and solution values for x1â€¦xn stored in the final column. Other than this, the code essentially implements the pseudocode we've done in class/in the book.

3) My program is written in C and is titled 'systemsol.c'. To compile it, type the command 'gcc systemsol.c'. An executable called 'a.out' will be created. In order to run the program, you need to type './a.out' with two command-line arguments, which define the names of the input and output files. An example: './a.out input.txt output.txt'. I'm providing a sample input file (with a 10x10 5-diagonal matrix). But the input file format should be as follows: first line should be the n dimension, second line should be the m value, then after a line break put the coefficient matrix (rows separated by line breaks, and each element in a row separated by a single space). After a line break put the b vector matrix, with each value separated by a line break. If any of this is confusing, please refer to the sample input file.
